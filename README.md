========

This is my solution to the CODE2040 API challenge.


# Iterations

## First Iteration
I read the first problem (to grab my token from the server via a POST request) and I had the urge to complete that part of the assignment in Python because it's so simple to do in that language. Before I knew it, I had completed the entire program in python, which in itself is not bad but I wanted to create a Web interface to my solution. The problem: in order to run my python code I would need to host the Web Application on a server, and run the python code through JavaScript ajax calls. 

## Second Iteration
Instead of doing all of that I decided to just port the project to JavaScript entirely so that I can solve the problems directly on the client side.

## Final Iteration
After having ported the challenge successfully, I created an interface for the application that visually showed the solutions for the problem. It is interactive, as you can click buttons to grab data and other buttons to solve the problems. It also includes visual feedback if you passed the challenge. I decided to go with a clean flat UI.

# Aftermath
I enjoyed solving the problems. In the past, I have used HTTP requests which came in handy for this challenge. It was an opportunity to put experience to use.
